# Quran Branch Manager

**Quran Branch Manager** is a modern, cross-platform desktop application designed to streamline the administrative operations of Quranic associations. Built with Electron and React, it provides an offline-first, secure, and user-friendly system to manage students, teachers, classes, finances, and more.

This application was developed to replace manual, paper-based workflows, offering a digital solution tailored to the needs of organizations like the National Quran Association in Tunisia.
