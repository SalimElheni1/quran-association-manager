# Building and Packaging the Application

This document provides instructions on how to build the application from source and create a distributable installer.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.x.x or later)
- npm (v10.x.x or later)

## Building the Application

To build the application and create a distributable installer, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Build Script:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to build the application and package it into an installer:
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

## Output Files

After the build process is complete, you will find the generated installer in the `release/` directory at the root of the project.

The installer will be a `.exe` file for Windows.

## Build Size Optimization

To ensure the final application package is as small as possible, we have configured the build process to exclude unnecessary files. This is managed through the `files` configuration in the `electron-builder.yml` file.

### `electron-builder.yml` Configuration

The `files` property in `electron-builder.yml` is configured to be very specific about what is included in the final build. Here is the relevant configuration:

```yaml
files:
  - from: .
    to: .
    filter:
      - package.json
      - "dist/renderer/**/*"
      - "src/main/**/*"
```

### How it Works

- **`from` and `to`**: This specifies that we are copying files from the project root (`.`) to the application package root (`.`).
- **`filter`**: This is the most important part. It's a list of glob patterns that explicitly defines what to include.
    - `package.json`: This is required for `electron-builder` to identify production dependencies and install them.
    - `"dist/renderer/**/*"`: This includes all the built files for the renderer process (the frontend React application). These are generated by the `npm run build` command.
    - `"src/main/**/*"`: This includes all the source files for the main process.

By explicitly listing only the necessary files and directories, we prevent any development-related files (like tests, scripts, documentation, configuration files, etc.) from being included in the final package. This significantly reduces the size of both the installer and the installed application.
